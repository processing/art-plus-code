# Introduction

When we think of code, we often picture functionality—algorithms, instructions, logic. But code can also be expressive. Just as a brushstroke can carry emotion or a poem can bend language, code can shape time, space, and interaction. It can draw lines, simulate forces, and create experiences that unfold over time.

Artists working with code aren’t just telling a computer what to do—they’re shaping a conversation between rules and randomness, intention and chance. What makes code a powerful medium is not just what it produces, but how it makes us think. It teaches precision while opening space for abstraction. It demands structure while allowing play. In this way, code is not only a tool—it’s a collaborator, a material, and a mirror to the way we imagine.

## 2D Art

### Drawing & Painting
#### [*Precarious*](https://camilleutterback.com/projects/precarious/) (2018)
Camille Utterback

![Camille Utterback, Precarious]({{ "https://camilleutterback.com/wp2022/wp-content/gallery/precarious-new/06.24.2019_Precarious_ScreenShot_001.jpg" | relative_url }})  
Close-up view of *Precarious*, interactive digital drawing.

In *Precarious*, Utterback transforms the ephemeral nature of human presence into dynamic digital drawings. As participants move within the installation space, their silhouettes are captured and rendered as a series of points that interact with each other, creating ever-evolving forms. These outlines are not static; they shift, merge, and dissipate as new participants enter, illustrating the transient and interconnected nature of our interactions. The artwork becomes a living canvas, continuously rewritten by the collective movement of its viewers.

#### [*Possible, Plausible, Potential*](https://www.creativeapplications.net/project/possible-plausible-potential-drawings-of-architecture-generated-by-code/) (2015)
Made in [Processing](https://processing.org/) by Miguel Nóbrega

![Miguel Nóbrega, Possible, Plausible, Potential]({{ "/assets/images/curriculum/Unit-0_Sample-2.jpg" | relative_url }})  
Installation view of *Possible, Plausible, Potential*, pen plotter drawing.

Nóbrega's *Possible, Plausible, Potential* embraces the unpredictability inherent in generative processes. Utilizing [Processing](https://processing.org/), he defines parameters within which randomness can unfold, allowing the code to partially dictate the outcome. The resulting pen plotter drawings are products of both intentional design and chance, reflecting a dialogue between artist and algorithm. This interplay challenges traditional notions of authorship and highlights the creative potential of relinquishing control.

> Nóbrega understands his process as one of defining the boundaries in which experiments will take place. The outcomes of these experiments are sometimes unpredictable, which will most likely add up to the process in a feedback loop. The role of the artist ends up being to interpret the results and based on them to redefine the boundaries of the program.

### Printmaking
#### [*Decode Kolams*](https://aarati.online/rituals-of-recursion) (2025)
Made in [p5.js](https://p5js.org) by Aarati Akkapeddi

![Aarati Akkapeddi, Decode Kolams]({{ "https://aarati.online/media/pages/rituals-of-recursion/cf3c70f922-1744573498/print_detail2.jpg" | relative_url }})  
Close-up view of *Decode Kolams*, screen-printed pattern generated in p5.js. 

Akkapeddi's *Decode Kolams* bridges cultural tradition and computational art by translating textual data into Kolam, a traditional art form from South India.  

> Kolams are traditionally made by women and created before sunrise. They comprise mathematically complex patterns that feature continuous intertwined lines.
>
> \- Aarati Akkapeddi

By converting characters into binary code and mapping them onto a grid, Akkapeddi's algorithm generates intricate patterns that honor the mathematical complexity of Kolams. The combination of language, code, and cultural expression invites viewers to consider the intersections of heritage and technology.

### Photography
#### [*Glance Back*](https://glanceback.info/) (2021)
Maya Man

*Glance Back* captures the fleeting nature of digital interactions by collecting and displaying selfies taken when one least expects it. This participatory artwork reflects on the performative aspects of online presence and the ways we curate our identities. By archiving these transient moments, it prompts contemplation on memory, self-representation, and the ephemerality of digital life.

> With this chrome extension, once a day at random when you open a new tab, Glance Back will quickly snap a photo of you and inquire: “What are you thinking about?”. Once you type your answer and press enter, the photo and thought will be collectively saved to your history of glances, cumulatively creating an archive of moments you share with your screen.
