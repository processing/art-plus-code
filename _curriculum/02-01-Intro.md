# Introduction

In [parameterized design](https://formandcode.com/code-examples/parameterize-chair), you are a conductor rather than an individual musician. Instead of producing a single design where you have to draw out all the details step by step, you are using code to create a set of parameters that generate a variety of results.

For this topic, you will create a mask generator using customized variables and the random() function. Plug the maximum/minimum values into the random() for each mask feature. The mask generator will create multiple variations of the mask through mouse or keyboard interactions. Test, iterate, and refine the parameters, paying close attention to details.

## Premise
Build a simple generator that makes multiple variations of the same mask.

## Learning Objectives
### Grade 6~8
- Create clearly named variables that store data, and perform operations on their contents.
- Test and analyze the effects of changing variables while using computational models.
- Decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate the design, implementation, and review of programs.
- Discuss issues of bias and accessibility in the design of existing technologies.
- Hands-on experience with variable scope. 
### Grade 9~12
- Study, discuss, and think critically about the potential impacts and implications of emerging technologies
on larger social, economic, and political structures, with evidence from credible sources.
- Compare levels of abstraction and interactions between application software, system software, and hardware.

## Technical Terms & p5.js Elements
### Grade 6~8
- System Variables vs. User-Defined Variables
- mouseX, mouseY
- width, height
- Data types
- Global vs. local variables
- random()
- mousePressed(), keyPressed()
- console.log()
### Grade 9~12
- Iterative design
