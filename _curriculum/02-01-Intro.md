# Introduction & Inspiration

> *How can instructions and systems transform into art? How can computation initiate new ideas of making or propel art forward?*

We could understand computation as a system of mathematical calculations – but more simply as a set of instructions (detailed information on how things should operate.) Early understandings of modern day programming can be traced to 1801, starting with Joseph M. Jacquard’s loom, Charles Babbage’s Analytical and Difference Engine and Ada Lovelace’s notes as the first programmer. But, the invention of transistors in 1953 allowed for a new wave of mass-production in computers. This technological shift could be felt in the art world. Technology's rapid expansion sparked a new age of contemporary art reflective of the systems, logic, and critique surrounding early digital, electronic computers. In 1963, Merce Cunningham and John Cage created *Rondo*, a dance performance using “chance operations,” a coin toss to determine the dance piece’s order, sequence, and form. In 1964, Yoko Ono wrote a series of poems in a book titled, Grapefruit, as a set of instructions ranging from beautiful to impossible. In 1960-64, Stanley Brouwn illustrated a drawing series of directions from random participants on the street instructing ways he should walk. Instructions found their way into the ever-evolving space of art, performance, poetry and dance; and became foundations to a new world of contemporary art. 

In this unit, we’ll use p5.js to create an “About Me” Collage, using shapes, colors, text and images to explore the editor's many features.

## Objectives

- Understanding the basics of the p5.js web editor
- Becoming comfortable with writing in Javascript syntax: finding, debugging and writing brackets, brackets vs. parenthesis, semi-colons for statements, and functions
- Creating a digital collage using p5.js code
- Learning about instructional art, engaging with conceptual artists that use instruction-making as art practice
- Linking history in instructional art as related and connected to history of computation. Understanding the resonance between computation, code, and art.

## Related Artists Discussion Questions

1. Many of these artworks are series of instructions; can you draw parallels between these instructions and basic syntax or structures of code?
2. In what ways do these artists challenge traditional notions of computation and coding? Conversely, how might they challenge traditional notions of art?
3. Merce Cunningham and John Cage use Chance Operations, a fundamental concept in their work and likened to Binary code, Randomness and Algorithms — why do you think it was so successful, unique or intriguing of artwork for its time? What do you think it speaks to in its legacy even now?
4. Sol LeWitt’s work is both the instruction and the visual output; what does it mean to you to write instructions that you may not execute, but for a computer / another human / another entity to do on your behalf?


## Unplugged Activities
### Chance Operations
**Materials you need:**

- Quarter or any coin, for each student
- 2 sheets of Paper
- Pencil, Pen, Markers

**Instructions** 

Part 1: 

1. Create a print out or have students fold a piece of paper in half (portrait / vertical). Have students write at the top of the paper “Heads” and “Tails” on the two halves. 
2. Then, they create a list of pairs. A pair of shapes, art forms, colors etc. in a duetted list. Feel free to call out the categories, or if older students, allow them to create their own. Like below:
    
    
    |  | Heads | Tails |
    | (Color) | Green | Blue |
    | (Shape) | Circle | Triangle |
    | (Line style) | Straight | Squiggly  |
    | (Drawing tool) | Color pencil | Marker |
3. After the list is done, using **Chance Operations,** students will flip a coin to determine aspects of their drawing within each category. For the example of colors, if the coin is Heads — the student will use Green as their main color. Have students circle which one “won” to make it easy. Here’s my own result:
    
    
    |  | Heads | Tails |
    | (Color) | **Green** | Blue |
    | (Shape) | Circle | **Triangle** |
    | (Line style) | Straight | **Squiggly**  |
    | (Drawing tool) | **Color pencil** | Marker |

Part 2: 

1. Students will now create a simple sketch with these results on the back of the paper or on a new sheet of paper. In the previous example, I will make a drawing using Green Color Pencils of Squiggly Triangles.
