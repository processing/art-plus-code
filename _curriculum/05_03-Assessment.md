# Assessment Activities & Checking for Understanding
![A collaborative garden created by Art+Code Teacher Participants (2024)]({{ "/assets/images/curriculum/Unit-5_Sample-1.png" | relative_url }})

## Assessment Activities

### Designing individual components and bringing them together:
* After discussing with their teammates, students build their own individual components of the collaborative drawing, incorporating animation. 
* Once the components are ready (or after the allotted time), group partners come together to bring the pieces into one sketch. The groups will have to discuss concerns like variable names and the order of the code.
* A helpful model for collaborating with code is the driver-navigator model, in which one person is in charge of typing and teammates tell them what to type.

### Exquisite Corpse Activity
* Share [starter sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/jyk/sketches/d6HszwGdF) with students. 
* Group students and assign each member of a group to a part of a face such as eye, mouth, nose, hair, accessories.
* Have each student write a function for their part of the face. 
* In a separate sketch, have students collect their functions into a common file, and call the functions they wrote inside the draw function. ([sample sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/jyk/sketches/WTzOHgeoy))
* Provide students with some time to work together to adjust their functions and debug any errors. (Extension: add user reactive or animated elements)
* Each group shares their ‘exquisite corpse’ to the class.
* Extension: Create a ‘crowd’ of exquisite corpses using and reusing the functions written by students (will require the use of parameters for x and y coordinates).

### Creating modular components
* Students independently create drawings that are meant to be reused for their collaborative drawing using functions and parameters.
* In groups, the students bring the components into one function. This process should be faster than the previous as less code will need to be edited to make it functional. 
* Groups work collaboratively to add animations to their system drawing. 
* Groups present their collaborative drawings to the class. 



## Checking for Understanding

**Do students grasp the core concepts of the topic?**
* Have student groups chosen a subject for their drawing that is complex enough to support the work of multiple artists/programmers?
* Does the final collaborative drawing demonstrate a compositional balance while displaying the individual styles of each contributor?


**Are the students comfortable with the technical aspects of the topic?**
* Are variables and functions being used strategically in service of the student’s visual goals?
* Are curly braces well organized?
* Are the components of the code functioning as intended without major errors?
* Are students using indentation, comments, variable and function names thoughtfully to keep their code organized?


**Are the students using their creative and visual communication skills?**
* How are the students modifying their individual designs to better fit the group’s goals?
* Are students able to maintain a balance between their individual styles and making their pieces fit into the group’s whole?


**How are the students keeping track of their personal and artistic growth?**
* How are students listening to their peers during discussion and collaboration?
* How are students balancing their technical skills with the skills of their team members?
* How are students supporting their teammates? 
* How are students describing the work of their teammates when presenting their collaborative drawings?
* Are students incorporating concepts and tools used in previous lessons?
