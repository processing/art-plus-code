## **Rubric for Art \+ Code Projects**

This rubric can be used to generally assess each of the Art \+ Code projects. It is meant to be a flexible starting point. You might see ways to connect these creative coding projects to what your students are already learning. We encourage you to make a copy and customize it to fit your class - adapt the language, add new categories, or shift the emphasis to highlight the skills and ideas that matter most in your space.

| **Design & Composition:** My project visually matches my idea.                                         | I made strong visual choices to match my idea. My project shows style, care, and attention to how everything looks and works together.      | I made thoughtful design choices that connect to the assignment. My project looks complete and makes sense.                          | I made some design choices, but parts feel unfinished or could be more clear.                                                  | I didn't think too much about how the project looks or how it connects to the goal of the lesson. |
| **Idea & Purpose:** My project expresses the idea I was trying to convey.                              | I used code and visuals in order to tell a clear, unique story or express a strong idea.                                                    | I used code and visuals in order to tell a story or show an idea.                                                                    | I started to use code and visuals to show a story or idea, but it needs more work.                                             | I’m still figuring out how to use code and visuals to express my idea.                            |
| **Use of Code:** I used different functions to make my project dynamic.                                | I used most functions from the "Technical Terms & p5.js Elements" section of the lesson in order to make my project interactive or dynamic. | I used some functions in the "Technical Terms & p5.js Elements" in order to build my project and make things move, appear, or react. | I used a few functions in the "Technical Terms & p5.js Elements" in order to build my project and make things appear and move. | I drew a few shapes in my p5.js sketch, but it does not move or react.                            |

| **Reflection & Feedback:** I improved my project based on feedback.                                    | I used feedback and reflection in order to improve my design or code.                                                                       | I listened to feedback in order to make changes to my work.                                                                          | I heard feedback but didn’t make changes based on it.                                                                          | I didn’t reflect on or revise my work yet.                                                        |
| **Documentation:** I used comments and named my project so others can read and understand my code.\*\* | I used comments or naming in order to explain my code clearly to others.                                                                    | I used some comments or names to make my code easier to understand.                                                                  | I have a few comments or names, but they’re confusing or unclear.                                                              | I haven’t added any comments or project names yet.                                                |

| **Creative Choices:** I made this project my own.                                                      | I made thoughtful creative choices to make this project feel like mine.
