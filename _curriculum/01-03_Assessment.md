# Assessment Activities & Checking for Understanding
![Create a digital drawing tool with P5JS!]({{ "/assets/images/curriculum/Unit-1_Sample-1.png" | relative_url }})

## Assessment Activities
Once ready, students should use the drawing tool they designed to create a drawing:
- Descriptors, using the same descriptors from the warm-up activities, students can create a drawing that depicts an object moving in a specific manner (slowly, hurriedly, loudly)
- Creating a blind contour drawing of the same subject that they did in the warm-up
- A common still-life arrangement: the class creates drawings of the same still, life arrangement.

Once the drawings are complete, they should be saved to the computer. It is recommended that the drawings are uploaded to a shared folder on Google Drive or a class’s LMS. The drawings can then be printed out to be displayed.

Students can also share their tools and resulting drawings. Questions to consider for discussion and reflection:
- Describe some of the P5JS elements that you used for your drawing tool (shapes, inputs, etc)
- Why did you make the decision to design your tool in the way that you did? E.g. did you create a translucent effect to mimic charcoal? Did you make the lines wider to have a more playful effect?
- What were some of the challenges that you ran into?
- Looking at the digital and physical drawings that you made, what are some observations that you make about the result?
- How does your drawing process compare when drawing in a physical or digital setting?
- If you had more time (and technical knowledge) how would you modify your design tool?


## Checking for Understanding

Do students grasp the core concepts of the topic?
- Do their drawings and digital tools demonstrate deliberate choices behind the lines used in their drawings?
- Do the lines in the digital and physical drawings align with the goals of their drawing (e.g fits in with a descriptor or concept).
- Is the code written by the student free of errors that prevent the code from working?

Are the students comfortable with the technical aspects of the topic?
- Do they make use of multiple tools discussed in the lesson? How much did they adapt the example code to fit their drawing’s goals?
- Are the methods being used deliberately and in order to support the purpose of the sketch? Or are they copying and pasting without much thought?
- Are the student’s questions specific to issues in their project? Or is it just ‘it’s not working’?

Are the students using their creative and visual communication skills?
- How many different techniques or combination of tools did they use before settling on an idea? Or did they stop at the first idea they came up with?
- Did the student extend themself by looking at tools beyond the demonstration?
- Is the student demonstrating a similar amount of care and attention to detail in their digital as well as physical drawings? 

How are the students keeping track of their personal and artistic growth?
- Was the student’s summary of their tool and drawings provide a clear and specific overview of their process?
- How did the student articulate the difference between the digital and physical drawing processes?
- How did the student manage frustration or challenges throughout the process and how did they comment on these challenges after they were resolved?
