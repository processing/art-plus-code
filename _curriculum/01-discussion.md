## What is interactivity in art?

Interactive art is a dynamic and evolving form of art that encourages and invites participation from its viewers. This engagement transforms the viewer from a passive observer to an active participant, creating unique experience. Aaron Smuts portrays true interactivity as characterized by responsiveness that is neither random nor fully controllable, distinguishing it from merely controllable media like novels or DVD players. This responsiveness can be seen in various forms of media, from stage plays adapting to audience reactions to digital installations changing based on user input.

Dominic M. McIver Lopes expands on this idea by suggesting that interactive artworks are realized through our interactions with them, challenging traditional notions of art. Interactive media, encompassing a broad array of digital medium that responds to user interaction, plays a significant role in this evolution. Thus, emerges developments of new tools and platforms for artists. As technology continues to evolve, the potential for interactivity in art expands.

Contrary to the most common definitions of interactivity, I argue that interactivity and control are incompatible. Confusing interactivity with control is the central mistake under lying the counterintuitive suggestions that novels, TVs, and DVD players are interactive. My definition is more restrictive than most, but it does not confine interactivity to a particular medium, such as computer technology; even a stage play could be interactive if it was appropriately responsive to audiences” (What Is Interactivity?, Aaron Smuts)

Showing that this is the case will, however require a new or, at least, expanded account of how artwork types can be instantiated. As a result, my argument, if sound, has implications for the ontology of art as a whole.” (The Ontology of Interactive Art, Dominic M. McIver Lopes)

## Introduction

Throughout history, the concept of interactive media in art has evolved alongside technological advancements, pushing the boundaries of traditional art forms and inviting viewers to actively engage in the artistic process. From Marcel Duchamp's "Rotary Glass Plates" to Myron Krueger's pioneering computer-controlled interactive art in 1969, artists have continually sought new ways to incorporate interactivity into their work. Interactive art has become a dynamic field, evolving with each technological breakthrough and reshaping how we perceive and engage with art.

Political themes and interactive art have intersected in works like Roy Ascott's "change-paintings," which invite participants to alter the artwork, reflecting the fluid nature of societal structures. In the mid-20th century, artists like Max Bense and Fritz Glarner created abstract kinetic sculptures, laying the groundwork for the interactive installations we see today. Jeffrey Shaw's "Legible City" (1989) exemplifies how interactive art can transform experiences, inviting viewers to navigate a virtual cityscape through physical interaction.

Interactive art is distinct from generative art in that it fosters a dialogue between the artwork and the participant, granting the viewer agency to influence the piece. Exhibitions such as Prix Ars Electronica, SIGGRAPH, and Transmediale showcase the latest innovations in interactive and generative art, highlighting the field's continued growth. From the earliest text-based video games and tools like Kid Pix and MS Paint to modern applications like Photoshop and Illustrator, the evolution of interactive media has profoundly impacted how art is created and experienced. As we delve into this lesson, we'll explore these developments and consider the future of interactivity in the arts.

    - Difference between Interactive vs Generative Art: “Interactive art can be distinguished from [generative art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art) in that it constitutes a dialogue between the artwork and the participant; specifically, the participant has agency, or the ability, even in an unintentional manner, to act upon the artwork and is furthermore invited to do so within the context of the piece, i.e. the work affords the interaction. More often, we can consider that the work takes its visitor into account. In an increasing number of cases, an installation can be defined as a "responsive environment", especially those created by [architects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect) and [designers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designer). By contrast, [Generative Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art), which may be interactive, but not responsive per se, tends to be a monologue – the artwork may change or evolve in the presence of the viewer, but the viewer may not be invited to engage in the reaction but merely enjoy it.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_art#cite_note-:0-2)” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_art#Interactivity_in_art))

## Related Artists Discussion Questions
1. How do all or each of these artists invite viewer or user participation, and how does the interactivity enhance the experience or expression of their artwork? What are the user’s role vs. the artist’s role in these interactions? And which interaction is most intriguing to you?
2. How might the work’s meaning or intention change if it had otherwise been non-interactive? In reflection to that, what does interactivity then add to the work?
3. Everest Pipkin, James Friend and Ivan Sutherland utilize toolmaking as part of their practice: some as open-source tools, some as participatory practice, some as tools for the individual artists. In what ways does digital toolmaking in relation to interactive art democratize the creation and consumption of art? In what ways might it be limited?
4. How might these works and artists reflect the evolution or changes in technology and art of its time?
