Have you ever seen those fancy lace decorations someone might put under their teacup during tea time? Those are called doilies. This artist used code to design doily patterns, but instead of flowers, her patterns are based on the shapes of viruses! She then used special machines to embroider these organic-looking doilies.

#### Let's Discuss
- How does using a computer change traditional crafts like embroidery?
- How does using code to generate visual patterns change the meaning of an art form or craft conventionally designed by hand?
- How can code help us see everyday things in new ways?

**Tip:** [PEmbroider](https://github.com/CreativeInquiry/PEmbroider) is an add-on tool that empowers Processing artists to export their sketches to a home embroidery machine!
