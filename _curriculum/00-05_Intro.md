### [*She Who Sees the Unknown*](https://shewhoseestheunknown.com/) (2017-2021)
Morehshin Allahyari (Persian: موره شین اللهیاری‎)

![Morehshin Allahyari, She Who Sees the Unknown]({{ "https://i0.wp.com/shewhoseestheunknown.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AllahyariM-SWSTU-TheLaughingSnake-01-5428x7286-1-scaled.jpg?ssl=1" | relative_url }})  
Close-up view of *The Laughing Snake (Persian: مار قهقهه)*, a 3D-printed figure.

This artist uses 3D modeling software (like digital clay) to recreate mythical creatures from Middle Eastern stories. Many of these stories were lost or forgotten over time. By rebuilding these creatures with code and 3D printing them, she brings old stories back to life.

> My work undermines the uneven economics of Western technocolonialism and the performative rhetoric of Islamic fundamentalism, through a ficto-feminist-figural expression of power.

#### Let's Discuss
- How can 3D printing help keep stories alive?
- What stories from your culture could be brought back with technology?
- How is making 3D art with code different from carving with your hands?
