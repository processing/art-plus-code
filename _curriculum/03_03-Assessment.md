# Assessment Activities & Checking for Understanding
![Create an original clock with p5.js!]({{ "/assets/images/curriculum/Unit-3_Sample-1.png" | relative_url }})

## Assessment Activities

Once ready, students should use the tools at hand, drawing, if/else statements, arithmetic and boolean operators to create their original clock design. 

Once the sketches are complete, they can be shared using a link to the editor. The links can be compiled into a shared document or spreadsheet. 

Students can share their work with their peers with a gallery walk:
- Students open up their sketch in full screen mode at their stations or on their desk. Students can provide a description of their approach next to their computer, similar to exhibition wall text.
- The class moves around the room to look at their peer’s work. 
- Students can leave each other feedback using post-it notes. 

Students can also share their tools and resulting drawings. Questions to consider for discussion and reflection:
- What were some of the specific sensations and feelings you wanted to convey with your clock? What visual elements did you use to convey those sensations and feelings?
- How did you incorporate the dynamic variables such as hour, minute, and second values into your sketch? Why did you choose those elements for those values?
- Were there moments of ‘unlearning’ you came across? (e.g. sticking too closely to a sundial design)



## Checking for Understanding

**Do students grasp the core concepts of the topic?**
Are the students applying text, drawing, clock components of p5.js to support the goals of their design? 
Are students trying new ways of conveying information?
Is the code written by the student free of errors that prevent the code from working?

**Are the students comfortable with the technical aspects of the topic?**
- Are students combining elements like if/else statements and boolean operators to create multiple possibilities for their design? 
- Are students applying computational logic effectively in their work (e.g. being deliberate about the order of their if/else statements)?
- Is the code free of errors and executing in the way the student intended?

**Are the students using their creative and visual communication skills?**
- How are students engaging with representing concepts through abstraction? 
- How responsive are students to feedback about their designs?
- Are students making an effort to deviate from familiar methods of representing time?

**How are the students keeping track of their personal and artistic growth?**
- How are students articulating their goals and process throughout the design and building stages?
- How are students providing feedback to each other? Is the feedback constructive and specific?
