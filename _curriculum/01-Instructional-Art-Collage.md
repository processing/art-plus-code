# Unit 1: Instructional Art

## Introduction

*How can instructions and systems transform a practice into an art experience? How can computation initiate new ideas of art-making? How can computation and fine art propel one another forward?*

We can understand computation as a system of mathematical calculations ‚Äì but more simply as a set of instructions (a detailed set of information on how things should operate.) Early understandings of modern day programming begun in 1801, starting with Joseph M. Jacquard‚Äôs loom, Charles Babbage‚Äôs Analytical and Difference Engine and Ada Lovelace‚Äôs notes as the first programmer. But, the invention of transistors (1953) allowed for a new wave of mass-production in computers. This technological shift could be felt in the art world. Technology's rapid expansion sparked a new age of contemporary art reflective of the systems, logic, and critique surrounding early digital, electronic computers. In 1963, Merce Cunningham and John Cage united to create *Rondo*, a dance performance using ‚Äúchance operations,‚Äù a nightly coin toss that would determine the dance piece‚Äôs order, sequence, and form. In 1964, Yoko Ono wrote a series of poems in a booked titled, Grapefruit, as a set of instructions ranging from the beautiful to the impossible. In 1960-64, Stanley Brouwn illustrated a drawing series of directions from random participants on the street instructing which ways he should walk. Instructions found their way into the ever-evolving space of art, performance, poetry and dance; and became foundations to a new world of contemporary art. 

In this topic, we‚Äôll use p5.js to create an ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù Collage, using shapes, colors, text and images to share more about each other; and as a way to explore the p5.js editor with its many features.

## Related Artists Discussion Questions

1. Many of these artworks ARE series of instructions; can you draw parallels between these instructions and basic syntax or structures of code?
2. In what ways do these artists challenge traditional notions of computation and coding? Conversely, how might they challenge traditional notions of art?
3. Merce Cunningham and John Cage use Chance Operations, a fundamental concept in their work and likened to Binary code, Randomness and Algorithms ‚Äî why do you think it was so successful, unique or intriguing of artwork for its time? What do you think it reflects on the current times back then? What do you think it speaks to in its legacy even now?
4. Sol LeWitt‚Äôs work is both the instruction and the visual output; what does it mean to you to write instructions that you may not execute, but for a computer / another human / another entity to do on your behalf?

### p5 Editor Basics

**Let‚Äôs take a look at the editor:** 

![Screenshot 2024-07-28 at 3.58.45‚ÄØPM.png](Unit%201%20Instructional%20Art%2012f5cf001d4e818a9bf7cf387c462170/Screenshot_2024-07-28_at_3.58.45_PM.png)

**What do you notice?**

- **setup()**
    - { code that runs once }
- **draw()**
    - { code that runs forever until you stop it.
    - But there is an order! The code here runs from top to bottom, then repeats until you quit the program. Each time the code is run through draw() is a frame.
    - Similar to camera or film, there is a frame per second that the code is run. p5.js has a default of running the code 60 times per second aka 60 frames per second. We can change the frame rate, using frameRate(#);
    - Think of a flip book animation created on screen by drawing an image, then drawing a slightly different image, then another, and so on. The illusion of fluid motion is created by persistence of vision. When a set of similar images is presented at a fast enough rate, our brains translate these images into motion. }
- **createCanvas(w, h);**
    - The w = width and h = height set the Canvas width and height
    - Play with the background color using ***background(r,b,g);*** to see the size of the canvas you created

---

## Lesson Plan 1: Syntax

Take a look at the basic syntax

- Functions have **()**
- Code related to the function are between **{ }**
- Properties are separated by commas **(x,y)**
- We end an instruction with a **semi-colon;**

**Order matters in your code!** 

The code will run first what is in setup(), then preload(), then draw() and then within draw() it will repeat it from TOP to BOTTOM. 

This translates to TOP of the code == BACK of the canvas, and BOTTOM of the code == FRONT of the canvas.

**Harvard Professor Explains Algorithms in 5 levels of Difficulty:** [https://youtu.be/fkIvmfqX-t0?si=1OCPmfbOraYCRn7i&t=48](https://youtu.be/fkIvmfqX-t0?si=1OCPmfbOraYCRn7i&t=48)

The idea is that we‚Äôre telling the computer a series of instructions. And the order does matter ‚Äì the bread needs to go down first, before the peanut butter. Just like how we need to add fill() before the objects to indicate which color marker we‚Äôre picking up next. And the specificity of these directions also matter:

<aside>
üß† Teacher Trick:
Print out code on sheets of paper from the example or templates of any and all projects/exercises. Have the students highlight, with different markers or highlighters, the bracket pairings in such a way that each bracket pairing is a different color marker. Help students identify where their code needs to go and look for brackets. As conditionals come into play or code gets longer, this activity will help student succeed in future debugging.

## Lesson Plan 2: Shapes + Colors + Text

### Shapes

[https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Shape](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Shape)

**Let‚Äôs start with trying some things out~**

Try using functions the below and swapping out the letters in pink with **numbers**:

- createCanvas(w, h);
- circle(x, y, d);
- ellipse(x, y, w, h);
- rect(x, y, w, h);
- line(x1, y1, x2, y2);

**Prompt:** How‚Äôd it go? What do you notice?

```jsx
function setup(){
	createCanvas(600,600);
}
function draw(){
	// circle(x=150, y=150, d=250);
  circle(150, 150, 250);
  // rect(x=500, x=400, w=200, h=400);
  rect(500, 400, 200, 400);
}
```

Notice, each one has their own syntax on HOW to use it

- circle(x, y, d);
    - X = center point‚Äôs X position
    - Y = center point‚Äôs Y position
    - D = diameter of circle
- rect(x, y, w, h);
    - X = top left corner‚Äôs X position
    - Y = top left corner‚Äôs Y position
    - W = width of rectangle
    - H = height of rectangle

Look into the Reference page to help you define how these functions work and how they need to be written!

<aside>
üß† **Teacher Trick**

Think of Functions and their Properties and how they might apply to the real world. Instead of Ellipse(x,y,d) ‚Üí Bread(where does it go, how many slices)

- We could say: **Bread(plate, 1, rye, 70%)** ‚Äî The function of bread and the properties of where we place the bread in space and how many slices, etc. Or we could additionally have optional properties like: grain type (rye, wheat, buckwheat) or hydration (70% vs 90%)
- We could say: **Flower(grass, pink, 5, short)** ‚Äî The function of Flower and the properties of where is the flower (in grass), what color is the flower (pink), how many petals does it have (5), what is the height (short).
- So when we say things like **Circle(x, y, d);** at the top of our code ‚Äì we‚Äôre suggesting, ‚Äúhey put a Circle down on the canvas first. And what‚Äôs that circle like: well it‚Äôs placed at ‚Äúx and y‚Äù, and it ‚Äúd‚Äù pixels in size.
</aside>

**üé®¬†In our About-Me Collage example:** We started the draw() section with shapes. We have a series of circles and rectangles. 

```jsx
function draw(){
	
	fill(201, 127, 56);
  circle(150, 150, 250);
  fill(201, 189, 56);
  rect(500, 400, 200, 400);
  fill(227, 149, 100, 100);
  circle(100,500,400);
  fill(227, 149, 100, 100);
  circle(800,100,400);
  
}
```

What is the fill() function? Perfect segue to: color!

### Colors

[https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Color](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Color) 

**Again, let‚Äôs start with trying out these functions below.** Swap out the colors in pink with some **numbers.** 

- fill(g);
- fill(r, g, b);
- fill(r, g, b, a);
- stroke(r, g, b, a); // color
- strokeWeight(w); // size
- background(r, g, b);

**Prompt:** What do you notice? What do you think the RGB stands for in fill()? What about when the G is solo in fill()? What about the A?

- *üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è¬†Answer*
    - RGB as in fill(r,g,b); stands for Red, Green and Blue
    - G as in fill(g); stands for Grey, as in Greyscale
    - If there is 1 parameter in the function, p5 will assume you‚Äôre referring to a Greyscale value == fill(g);
    - If there are 2 parameters in the function, p5 will assume you‚Äôre referring to a Greyscale value and an Alpha value == fill(g,a);
    - If there are 3 parameters in the function, p5 will assume you‚Äôre referring to RGB == fill(r,g,b);
    - If there are 4 parameters in the function, p5 will assume you‚Äôre referring to RGB and an Alpha value == fill(r,g,b,a);
    

Let‚Äôs review:

```jsx
function draw(){
	//fill(red=255, green=0, blue=0, alpha=50); this is out of 255
	fill(255, 0, 0, 50);
	//stroke(red=255, green=0, blue=0);
	stroke(255, 0, 0);
}
```

We use functions like fill() or stroke() ‚Äì to fill the object with a color, or to outline the object with a color.

- fill(r, g, b, a);
- stroke(r, g , b ,a);
    - r = red
    - g = green
    - b = blue
    - a = alpha (transparency)
    - values go up to 255. This is a common convention in many other tools.

**üé®¬†In our About-Me Collage example:** To go back to our code template and example, you can see between each shape is a different fill color. And also, instead of coloring a stroke, we can use a function called ‚ÄúnoStroke();‚Äù to remove stroke weights from our shapes. So this will only be different filled colored shapes with no stroke:  

```jsx
function draw(){
	
	// ADD SHAPES + COLORS
  noStroke();
  fill(201, 127, 56);
  circle(150, 150, 250);
  fill(201, 189, 56);
  rect(500, 400, 200, 400);
  fill(227, 149, 100, 100);
  circle(100,500,400);
  fill(227, 149, 100, 100);
  circle(800,100,400);

}
```

We use other functions to play with the outline of shapes: 

- noStroke(); == removes all stroke weight
- strokeWeight(n); == changes stroke weight / thickness
- stroke(r,g,b,a); == like fill() except, it colors the outline of the shape

<aside>
üß† **Teacher Trick**
Think of fill() or stroke() as **the marker**! In code, ORDER MATTERS. Sometimes it helps to envision the instruction as:

fill(255,0,0); == PICK UP the RED marker
circle(100,100,100); == Use the red marker to draw the circle 
fill(0,255,0); == PICK UP the GREEN marker 
circle(200,200,200); == Use the green marker to draw the circle
fill(0,0,255); == PICK UP the BLUE marker 
circle(300,300,300); == Use the blue marker to draw the circle

</aside>

### Text

We use functions like text() ‚Äì to add text to our p5.js Canvas. Note that this is not the same as an HTML, p.Element, etc. 

```jsx
text("insert your text here", x, y, [optional textbox width], [optional textbox height]);
```

**üé®¬†In our About-Me Collage example:** We can add quotes or fun text, even emojis to our collage.

```jsx
function draw(){

	// ADD TEXT + TEXT SIZE + FONTS
  textFont("Courier New");
  textSize(32);
  stroke(201, 138, 56);
  strokeWeight(5);
  fill(82, 50, 10);
  text(
    "‚ÄúBeware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful.‚Äù ‚Äî Mary Shelley, Frankenstein",
    153,
    502,
    400
  );
  // ADD EMOJIS
  textSize(100);
  text("üñãÔ∏èüìùüìö", 500,200);
  
}
```

Notice, we can also add unique things to make our text interesting:

- fill(), stroke() and strokeWeight() will also impact the color of the text
- textFont(‚Äúfont name‚Äù); == We can select from a predetermined list of available fonts. The default is Helvetica.
- textSize(n); == Change the size of your text

### Practice

**Start here (Easy)**

How might you create 3 circles of different sizes layered on top of each other with different colors each? 

- üôã*Answer*
    
    ```jsx
    function setup() {
      createCanvas(400, 400);
    }
    
    function draw() {
      background(220);
      //Red, Large circle 
      fill(255,0,0);
      circle(200,200,300);
      
      //Green, Medium circle 
      fill(0,255,0);
      circle(200,200,200);
      
      //Blue, Small circle
      fill(0,0,255);
      circle(200,200,100);
    }
    ```
    

**Extra push (Hard)**

How might you create a classic yellow smiley face with the shapes and colors you‚Äôve learned so far? 

- üôã*Answer*
    
    This is certainly not the only answer - as this question is open to interpretation, but can be helpful in reference:
    
    ```jsx
    // Reference image: https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.3888616900.2564/st,small,507x507-pad,600x600,f8f8f8.jpg
    
    function setup() {
      createCanvas(400, 400);
    }
    
    function draw() {
      background(220);
      // Yellow circle with black stroke 
      fill(255, 208, 0);
      circle(200,200,300);
      stroke(0);
      strokeWeight(10);
      
      // Eyes
      fill(0);
      ellipse(150,150,30,50);
      ellipse(250,150,30,50);
      
      // Mouth
      noFill();
      arc(200,200,200,200, PI*2, PI);
      line(90,200,110,200);
      line(290,200,310,200);
    
    }
    ```

### Prompts

1. Without worrying about the actual code syntax, how might you write instructions for a friend on how you‚Äôd design a flower? Or a house? A rainbow? 
2. How does it feel to write out every specific instruction for every action the computer needs to take: like writing fill() as in every time one needs to change color / pick up a new ‚Äúmarker‚Äù? Can you think of other examples in the world where clarify and specificity is useful and necessary?

## Lesson 3: Importing Images and Media

This applies for all media: images, video, gif: [https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Image](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Image)

### Preloading any media

- **preload()**
    - { code that runs before the draw() code begins
    - Helpful when you have media. Otherwise, sometimes the code will look for the images / sound / video. And if it isn‚Äôt there, the program will freak out. Preloading your media prevents this issue. }

Use the preload() function to ensure that your media is uploaded before the code runs to prevent issues.

In the example below ‚Äúimg‚Äù is the variable name, and we‚Äôre assigning it the value of the loaded image. 

img = loadImage('assets/yourImageFileNameHere.jpg');

---

Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt know what a variable is quite yet! We‚Äôll cover that in our next unit :) Try it out for now. 

### Loading Images

Images can be loaded directly into your p5.js sketch on the Editor, using the ‚Äú+‚Äù button next for your Sketch Files. There are file size limitations on the web editor.

[https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdY2Nb5H5AShRstLx5SkI4Ho3xNRfZcxQRKcCVc9H6K4u92R_i_H8HJDwFMBBSgtiKXmaYjWIF-gsnyVaiFpLFd2TZHALO_CgkQubmRKnqawisDHysjl7MAdZXOgZJBBGRG0MGQ1eSUO_HheV1kbhLM-4Y?key=F-S1j5G6bHDaZ0HWIyKiDw](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdY2Nb5H5AShRstLx5SkI4Ho3xNRfZcxQRKcCVc9H6K4u92R_i_H8HJDwFMBBSgtiKXmaYjWIF-gsnyVaiFpLFd2TZHALO_CgkQubmRKnqawisDHysjl7MAdZXOgZJBBGRG0MGQ1eSUO_HheV1kbhLM-4Y?key=F-S1j5G6bHDaZ0HWIyKiDw)

Images can be loaded using links from websites: refer to class About Me template. The puppy and gif images were both directly loaded from the internet

Tips

- Make sure that your file name is exactly as written on your file, and you can always rename it in the Editor
- Always make sure your put media in preload() and within a variable (we will go over variables in the following unit).

```jsx
let img;

// Load the image into a variable called img
function preload() {

	img = loadImage('assets/yourImageFileName.jpg');

}

function setup() {

	createCanvas(100, 100);

	// Draw the image using the image function
	image(img, 0, 0);

}
```

### Loading other media

Try loading a gif, image (png, jpg), or even [fonts](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/loadFont)!

If you want to try using videos: [https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createVideo](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createVideo)

**In this assignment, you will create an ‚ÄúAbout Me Collage‚Äù** 

Feel free to incorporate images, shapes, colors, or text to your digital collage. 

Consider how:

- Instructions can be clear, in a specific order, and precise to actuate your desired visual output OR unclear, random, and up to chance to produce something unexpected
- Instructions can give meaning to the work outside of the output itself
- Instructions operate in computation and coding, as well as in an art practice

Feel free to:

- Use other photo editing software (ie. Photoshop, Lightroom) to edit images or cut out specific pieces. You can save them as individual PNG files to then digitally collage with.

## Modifications

For K-8: Create a Collage focused only on form and composition of shapes and choice of color palette.  

- Refer to color wheels for color palette inspiration, and focus on getting students to translate a color from the wheel into an R,G,B code value using the help of RGB Color pickers (accessible on Google using Chrome).
- Refer to shape charts to help students understand the relationship of Cartesian coordinate systems to code syntax.

For 9-12: Create an About Me Collage that includes all lessons above. In the provided example, I selected the theme of favorite books. It can be useful to have a ‚Äúscavenger hunt‚Äù-type list to prompt students:

- What is your favorite book? ‚Ä¶color? ‚Ä¶movie? ‚Ä¶emoji? ‚Ä¶quote?

## Assessments

As an educator and facilitator, we‚Äôre looking for a thorough understanding of:

- **Familiarity of syntax**. An ability to locate bracket pairings and identify the differences between various syntax items
    - Can the student highlight the correct bracket pairings in code? And where to put their code between which brackets?
    - Can the student identify when to use a semicolon? what a function (ie. setup() and draw()) looks like? where the statements or instructions go within functions?
    - Can the student identify how the Cartesian coordinate system relates to the syntax (what we mean by X and Y position)? Or relationships to mathematics (arithmetic and geometry) - ie. diameter for circle, width and height for rectangles, etc.
- Develop a productive workflow
    - Can the student identify where to properly search for help? If it‚Äôs a function or code vocab word they don‚Äôt know, do they check References? If it‚Äôs inspiration, do they check Examples?
    - Can the student refer to the Console Log and utilize it for debugging issues?
    - Can the student set up a desktop environment that helps them best navigate the Web Editor and Reference page? Or, even the desk itself: starting with drawing out their code ideas with pen and paper first?
- Instructional arts
    - Can the student find connections and interesting links between computation and programming with instructional art?
