# Assessment Activities & Checking for Understanding
![Recreate a pattern using P5JS]({{ "/assets/images/curriculum/Unit-7_Sample-1.png" | relative_url }})
## Assessment Activities

Once ready and comfortable with loops, students can recreate the patterns they’ve found:
* Students should start off with setting the details for a single instance of the pattern. For instance, if the repeating element is a flower, students should first draw out a single flower in its entirety.
* Students should then implement a loop to repeat the element. 
* Students should use the reference they have of the pattern, such as a photo or the sketch they did throughout the coding process.
	
Once finished, students can use the save function to save their image. The drawings can be displayed in a gallery either digitally or printed. Students can also play a guessing game with the results, trying to identify the source of the patterns.


## Checking for Understanding

**Do students grasp the core concepts of the topic?**
- How much do the selected patterns reflect a close observation of the students’ environment? Have the students sought out patterns from surprising aspects of their environment? E.g. going beyond obvious examples. 
- Are the designs of the patterns (sketches and coded) arranged in a balanced composition?
- Have the students made discoveries about details within their pattern as they go through the process? (e.g. noticing variations in color or small details as they code?)


**Are the students comfortable with the technical aspects of the topic?**
- What is the balance the student is finding between repeating lines of code and using a loop?
- Are students applying counter variables effectively in their loops?
- Are students using loops to iterate different elements of their pattern?
- How are students using arithmetic expressions and boolean operations to extend the use of their loop(s)?


**Are the students using their creative and visual communication skills?**
- How closely do the details in their digital drawings reflect observations the students have made about their pattern?
- How are the students editing their design based on the limitations of the drawing tools they have? (e.g. how might they be addressing irregular shapes)
- What kind of choices are the students making to make their pattern appropriate for digital drawing? Are they purposefully enhancing, simplifying or removing certain elements?


**How are the students keeping track of their personal and artistic growth?**
- How are students reflecting on their environments while selecting their patterns?
- How are students providing each other feedback prior to coding? Is the feedback constructive and tied to the process of coding with P5JS?
- How engaged is the student with the goals of the project? i.e. are they rushing through the selection process?
- How is the student making modifications to their design based on their comfort level with technical components?
