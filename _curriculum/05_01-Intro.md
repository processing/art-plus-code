# Introduction & Inspiration

> I  think as you evolve and grow as an artist, if you’re not willing to bring people with you and just share your success, then I mean, you’re not really creating impact or inspiring.

> \- Mickalene Thomas, Interview Magazine, 2023

Combining discrete components together in balance is a goal in almost every field, but especially in art and computer science. Just like different parts of a machine needs to function independently but in tandem with the other parts, elements of a visual composition needs to be in harmony with others. The need for balance also applies to collaboration between people. In this topic, students learn about creating modular drawings and collaborate with each other to create an animated drawing that brings pieces of code together in a way that is both functional and visually thoughtful.  


## Objectives
- Practicing collaborative strategies across traditional and digital media
- Gainer deeper understanding of harmony within composition through the placement of discrete elements
- **Visual Arts Vocabulary**: composition, movement, harmony, balance


## Technical Terms & p5.js Elements
- variable declaration & instantiation
- arithmetic operators
- if/else statements & boolean operators
- functions, parameters
- variable scope

## Timeline
This project will take approximately five to seven 45min sessions:
1. Brainstorming and Group Discussions
2. Individual Drawing & Animation
3. Combining works
4. Functions (Exquisite Corpse Activity)
5. Creating Functions
6. Combining Works (with additional Animations)
7. Presentations


## Warm-Up Exercises
### Collective Brainstorming:
- After viewing the reference artworks and thinking about rube goldberg machines, brainstorm with the class scenes of “elements working independently together”. 
- Examples that may help with the ideation process can include ecosystems in nature, machinery, athletic teams, celestial systems.
- Having students brainstorm individually before a large group discussion can help facilitate greater diversity of ideas. 

### Exquisite Corpse
- Group students into groups of 2-4 (ideally 3). Provide each student with a blank piece of paper and a drawing utensil. 
- Each student draws the head of a figure, then folds the paper so that their drawing is not visible but the bottom connecting lines are. 
- Students pass their paper to their neighbor.
- Each student draws a torso, then repeats the fold so that the torso they drew is obscured.
- The drawing and folding step is repeated to complete the figure. 
- In their groups, students reveal their figures and observe the strange and surprising figure they have completed together.

### Group Brainstorming
- Students form groups of approximately 3-4 members. In their group, students collaborate on an idea for an animated drawing that illustrates the concept of independent elements working together as a whole. 
- Students divide up components to execute independently and create drafting documents or sketches of those elements. Each student should complete two components, a singular one and one that will be in multiples. For example, if the students are creating a garden, one student would do the sun and flower. There will be one sun and multiple flowers. Students should also consider animation as well as shapes and color in their sketches.
- Students come back together in a group to share their designs. Group members should provide each other feedback and discuss ideas to bring the elements together with balance and compositional harmony while maintaining the individual voices of the artists.
