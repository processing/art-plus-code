# Introduction

Every street, building, and corner in your neighborhood has a story. Maybe it’s where your grandma used to live, where your friends hang out after school, or where you had your first ice cream meltdown.

In this project, you’ll mix hand-drawn drawings and p5.js to build an interactive digital collage of your neighborhood. You’ll create a character (that can be you, a made-up guide, or even a stray cat), who takes us on a tour of your world.

This is your chance to share memories, conversations, and stories that make your neighborhood yours.

## Learning Objectives
### Grade 6~8
- Using images and code together to build a digital scene
- Making characters move and react using your keyboard or mouse
- Telling a story through interactive art
- Observing the world around you and turn it into a creative project
- Testing and analyzing the effects of changing variables while using computational models
- Creating clearly named variables that store data, and perform operations on their contents
- Designing and iteratively developing programs that combine control structures and use compound conditions
- Decomposing problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate the design, implementation, and review of programs
- Seeking and incorporating feedback from team members and users to refine a
solution that meets user needs
- Using flowcharts and/or pseudocode to design and illustrate algorithms that solve complex problems

### Grade 9~12
- Justifying the selection of specific control structures by identifying tradeoffs
- Creating more generalized computational solutions using collections instead of repeatedly using simple variables.

## Technical Terms & p5.js Elements
### Grade 6~8
- async setup()
- image()
- IF, Else, Else If
- Operators
- mouseIsPresse(), keyIsPressed()
- Flowchart
- dist()

### Grade 9~12
- Boolean variable
- text()
- Parallel IFs vs. nested IFs
- describe()
- Playtest
