# Lesson Plans & Technical Steps

## 1. Setting Up Your Environment

To begin writing code using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), you need to set up the coding environment to write and save your programs. [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/) provides the [p5.js Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/), a website where programmers can write, test, share, and remix p5.js programs without needing to download or install a code editor on a computer.

  ![p5.js Editor interface breakdown]({{ "https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/blob/main/src/content/tutorials/images/introduction/p5_editor_interface_breakdown.png?raw=true" | relative_url }}) 

1. Now that you‚Äôve created an account, which allows you to save and share your work, we‚Äôre ready to take a deeper look at [p5.js Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)‚Äôs interface.
1. You have the option of switching to another language by clicking on "English" in the navigation menu. 
1. You also have the option to make the interface more accessible by clicking on Settings in the toolbar and updating Theme, Text Size, and Accessibility for screen readers. 
1. To view the output of the default code inside the text editor, click the Play button in the top left corner.    ![p5.js Editor interface breakdown]({{ "https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/blob/main/src/content/tutorials/images/introduction/p5_editor_running_a_sketch.png?raw=true" | relative_url }}) 
1. After clicking the Play button, you can expect to see a light gray canvas, measuring 400 x 400 pixels, appear in the preview area. We invite you to update one of the ‚Äú400‚Äù numbers inside the text editor to a smaller number, click on the Play button again, and see what happens! üòÉ
1. Last but not least, the [p5.js Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) defaults to using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) version 1.11.5. However, we will be covering some exciting and new p5.js features in this lesson plan, so please change your settings to switch over to the latest version of p5.js.
![p5.js Editor version switcher]({{ "/assets/images/ui/version_switcher_1.png" | relative_url }}) 
![p5.js Editor version switcher]({{ "/assets/images/ui/version_switcher_2.png" | relative_url }}) 
![p5.js Editor version switcher]({{ "/assets/images/ui/version_switcher_3.png" | relative_url }}) 

### 1D. Renaming, saving, and sharing sketches
1. By default, the [p5.js Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) will generate a playful name for your first sketch. You can rename your sketch by clicking on the pencil icon above the text editor and typing in a name for your project.  ![Renaming a sketch]({{ "https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/blob/main/src/content/tutorials/images/introduction/p5_editor_naming_a_sketch.png?raw=true" | relative_url }}) 
1. Save projects by clicking on File in the top toolbar and selecting Save. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut keys Control+S (PC) or Command+S (Mac).  ![Saving a sketch]({{ "https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/blob/main/src/content/tutorials/images/introduction/p5_editor_saving_a_sketch.png?raw=true" | relative_url }})  ![Saved notification]({{ "https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/blob/main/src/content/tutorials/images/introduction/p5_editor_saved_sketch_notification.png?raw=true" | relative_url }})  

**Tips:** Make sure you are logged in to your account, or you will not be able to save the sketch. Saving projects frequently helps ensure that code isn‚Äôt lost if something happens to your computer, browser, or internet connection while you're coding.
{: .notice--success}

### 1E. Sharing, downloading, and deleting your sketches
1. Once your project is saved, you can share it! Click on File in the navigation menu, select Share, and copy one of the links provided to share your project in Embed, Fullscreen, and Edit modes. 
1. If you share your project link with a teacher or classmate, you are giving them the permission to view all of your sketches stored on the [p5.js Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/). This is because all sketches stored in the [p5.js Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) are publicly viewable. Additionally, it‚Äôs also possible for your sketches to show up in search engine results. 
1. There are numerous benefits to projects being shared publicly on the Internet ‚Äì p5.js programmers can draw inspiration from each other‚Äôs creativity and exchange valuable knowledge.
1. However, there are also risks associated with publicly available projects. You should always be cautious about the kinds of personal information you include in your projects, and avoid saving sensitive data, including but not limited to:
    1. Your name
    1. Location
    1. Phone number  
    1. Email address
    1. ID number
    1. Biometric data - this is data that could identify you, like a picture of your face, a sound clip of your voice, etc. Sharing sensitive data like this could put you at risk for dangers like identity theft.
1. If you‚Äôd like to remove a sketch from the public‚Äôs view, you can download the sketch to your local computer and delete it from your [p5.js Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) account. Click on File, select Open, find the sketch you hope to remove, then click on the downward triangle arrow on the right-hand side and select Download. 
![p5.js Editor download sketch]({{ "/assets/images/ui/download_sketch_1.png" | relative_url }}) 
![p5.js Editor download sketch]({{ "/assets/images/ui/download_sketch_2.png" | relative_url }}) 
![p5.js Editor download sketch]({{ "/assets/images/ui/download_sketch_3.png" | relative_url }}) 
1. Once the sketch is downloaded to your computer, select "Delete" from the same menu. And voila! You‚Äôre now saving your sketches more securely by creating a physical backup of your files on your computer.

## 2. Shape
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hISICBkFa4Q?si=U-LWuegXM9xtLfXg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### 2A. p5.js canvas coordinates
By default, every new p5.js sketch you create on the p5.js Editor will contain the following code:

```jsx
function setup(){
  createCanvas(400,400);
}
```

The [createCanvas()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/createCanvas/) feature enables you to set the width and height of the canvas. This will determine the physical limit of your drawing surface. Try updating the numbers in between the parentheses in the following sequence, click the Play button, and see what happens:

```jsx
function setup(){
  createCanvas(600,400);
}
```

```jsx
function setup(){
  createCanvas(400,600);
}
```

```jsx
function setup(){
  createCanvas(600,600);
}
```
**Mini-Challenge:** Can you tell which value determines the canvas width and which value determines the canvas height?
{: .notice--warning} 

**Tips:** Similar to the logic of image editing software, you can only create one canvas per sketch. 
Additionally, it‚Äôs not possible to animate canvas size while a sketch is playing. 
{: .notice--success}

#### 2B. p5.js coordinate system
We‚Äôre on our way to placing shapes on the canvas. Do you recall the Cartesian coordinate system taught in math classes? Don‚Äôt worry, we believe this to be much simpler! The p5.js canvas features an invisible coordinate system that originates from an X position of 0 and a Y location of 0 in the top-left corner. 

![p5.js coordinate system]({{ "https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/blob/main/src/content/tutorials/images/introduction/coordinates.png?raw=true" | relative_url }}) 

As a shape on the canvas moves to the right of this point, its [X-coordinate value increases](https://editor.p5js.org/Msqcoding/full/AM5ZwrmNo/). As an object on the canvas moves down from this point, its [Y-coordinate value rises](https://editor.p5js.org/Msqcoding/full/jZeTUjZfZ/).

**Code Snippet:** Explore the p5.js coordinate system with this [pixel ruler tool](https://editor.p5js.org/xinemata/sketches/gjWtrowcK) created by Alp Tug«én, a p5.js Contributor. 
{: .notice--info} 

#### 2C. Drawing simple shapes
Now that we‚Äôve covered the basics of the coordinate system, let‚Äôs draw a rectangle on the canvas by using the [rect()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/rect/) feature!    

```jsx
function setup() {  
  createCanvas(400, 400); // w, h
}

function draw() { 
  background(220); 
  rect(0, 0, 40, 40); // x, y, w, h
}
```  

**Code Snippet:** [Single rect()](https://editor.p5js.org/xinemata/sketches/F71Lv0ddE).
{: .notice--info} 

You should see an adorable white rectangle appearing in the upper-left corner of the canvas. Digging deeper into the syntax of [rect()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/rect/), we‚Äôd learn that within the parentheses, the first number sets the X position; the second number sets the Y position; the third number sets the width; and the fourth number sets the height of the rectangle. 

![p5.js rectangle illustration]({{ "/assets/images/curriculum/Unit-1_Sample-8.png" | relative_url }}) 

Now, add a couple more rectangles to the canvas. You‚Äôre invited to experiment with different x, y, width, and height values. Go wild! 

```jsx
function setup() {  
  createCanvas(400, 400); // w, h
}

function draw() { 
  background(220); 
  rect(0, 0, 40, 40); // x, y, w, h
  rect(40, 40, 40, 40); // x, y, w, h
  rect(80, 80, 40, 40); // x, y, w, h
}
```
**Code Snippet:** [Multiple rect()](https://editor.p5js.org/xinemata/sketches/gWHc2OalC).
{: .notice--info} 

**Mini-Challenge:** The example above uses rectangles to form the start of a diagonal line. Can you complete it so that the diagonal line extends across the entire canvas to reach the bottom-right corner?
{: .notice--warning} 

Once you feel more comfortable with drawing rectangles on canvas, we‚Äôll switch over to drawing ellipses using the [ellipse()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/ellipse/) feature. In coding, it‚Äôs always a good idea to start small. So let‚Äôs begin by drawing a single ellipse on the canvas:

```jsx
function setup() {  
  createCanvas(400, 400); // w, h
}

function draw() { 
  background(220); 
  ellipse(0, 0, 40, 40); // x, y, w, h
}
```
**Code Snippet:** [Single ellipse()](https://editor.p5js.org/xinemata/sketches/jW_Pq_vCu).
{: .notice--info} 
Hmmm... ü§î Even though I‚Äôm trying to align the ellipse with the upper-left corner by setting X and Y to 0, it‚Äôs not behaving as expected. It is as if the edge of the canvas is cutting off the ellipse, and we're only seeing a quarter of the shape. Why is this happening?

It turns out that in computer graphics, rectangles and ellipses have different anchor points:

![rect diagram]({{ "https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/blob/main/src/content/tutorials/images/introduction/rect-diagram.png?raw=true" | relative_url }})

The rectangle‚Äôs anchor point is on the upper left corner, and the ellipse‚Äôs anchor point is in the center of the shape.

![ellipse diagram]({{ "https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/blob/main/src/content/tutorials/images/introduction/ellipse-diagram.png?raw=true" | relative_url }}) 

If you want to set the anchor point for ellipses to the upper-left corner, you can add the [ellipseMode()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/ellipseMode/) feature and set it to CORNER.

![p5.js ellipseMode illustration]({{ "/assets/images/curriculum/Unit-1_Sample-9.png" | relative_url }}) 

```jsx
function setup() {  
  createCanvas(400, 400); // w, h
  ellipseMode(CORNER);
}

function draw() { 
  background(220); 
  ellipse(0, 0, 40, 40); // x, y, w, h
}
```

**Code Snippet:** [ellipseMode()](https://editor.p5js.org/xinemata/sketches/-AxE_NPc-).
{: .notice--info} 

**Tips:** Alternatively, if you want to set the anchor point for rectangles to the center, you can use the [rectMode()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/rectMode/) feature and set it to CENTER. 
{: .notice--success}

After adding the [ellipseMode()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/ellipseMode/) feature, your ellipse should be aligned to the upper-left corner. Now, let‚Äôs combine this drawing with the rectangle we drew:

```jsx
function setup() {  
  createCanvas(400, 400); // w, h
  ellipseMode(CORNER);
}

function draw() { 
  background(220); 
  ellipse(0, 0, 40, 40); // x, y, w, h
  rect(0, 0, 40, 40); // x, y, w, h
}
```

Something is not quite right. We‚Äôve drawn both [ellipse()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/ellipse/) and [rect()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/rect/), but the rectangle is the only visible shape on the canvas. What happens if we switch the order of the [ellipse()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/ellipse/) and rect() code?

```jsx
function setup() {  
  createCanvas(400, 400); // w, h
  ellipseMode(CORNER);
}

function draw() { 
  background(220); 
  rect(0, 0, 40, 40); // x, y, w, h
  ellipse(0, 0, 40, 40); // x, y, w, h
}
```

**Code Snippet:** [ellipse() + rect()](https://editor.p5js.org/xinemata/sketches/29C52nZDz).
{: .notice--info} 

The ellipse should now be sitting on top of your rectangle. What this tells us is that the order in which you code your shapes matters. p5.js is built on JavaScript, and JavaScript renders code on the fly from top to bottom. Coding the rectangle first means that the rectangle is drawn first, and then it gets covered by the ellipse, which comes later.
