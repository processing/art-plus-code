## Why Use Code to Make Art?
Code is special because it can:
- Respond to people - Art can change based on how you move or what you do
- Never stop changing - Digital art can keep evolving and growing
- Combine old and new - Artists can mix traditional techniques with computer power
- Tell interactive stories - You can be part of the artwork, not just look at it
- Preserve culture - Old traditions can be saved and shared in new ways
