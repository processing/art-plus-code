## Video & Animation
### *The Earth Eaters* (2025)
Made in [Processing](https://processing.org/) by Marina Zurkow and James Schmitz

Installation view at the Parting Worlds exhibition, Whitney Museum, NY.

This is a never-ending animation made with code. It tells a story about floating islands. Little creatures live on the islands, but miners keep digging away at the land. The story never stops - it keeps cycling through creation and destruction.

##### Let's Discuss
- What makes this different from a normal video?
- What emotions do you feel watching things being built and destroyed?
