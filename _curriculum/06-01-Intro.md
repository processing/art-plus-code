# Introduction & Inspiration

*How can art transform viewers into active participants? How can interactivity catalyze unique, immersive, and responsive experiences? How might a viewer, user, participant deepen their understanding of an art piece’s meaning and expression by interacting with it?*

Throughout history, interactive media has evolved in tandem with technological advancements, pushing boundaries of traditional art and inviting viewers to actively engage in the artistic process. From Marcel Duchamp's "Rotary Glass Plates" to Myron Krueger's pioneering computer-controlled interactive art in 1969, artists have continually sought new ways to incorporate interactivity into their work. 

Interactive art is distinct from generative art in that it fosters a dialogue between the artwork and the participant, granting the viewer agency to influence the piece. From the earliest text-based video games to tools like Kid Pix and MS Paint to modern applications like Photoshop and Illustrator, the evolution of interactive media has profoundly impacted how art is created and experienced. As we delve into this lesson, we'll explore these developments and consider the future of interactivity in the arts.

## Objectives

- Understanding the basics of building a computational logic, specifically Conditional statements to execute interactivity.
- Becoming comfortable with coding mouse- and key- functions, booleans, special variables and operators.
- Creating an illustrative tool and program that others and themselves can use to create unique drawings.
- Learning about programmatic drawings, code-based illustrations, and the relevant artists in this space.

## Related Artists Discussion Questions

1. How do all or each of these artists invite user participation, and how does the interactivity enhance the experience or expression of their artwork? What are the user’s role vs. the artist’s role in these interactions? And which interaction is most intriguing to you?
2. How might the work’s meaning or intention change if it had otherwise been non-interactive? In reflection to that, what does interactivity then add to the work?
3. Everest Pipkin, James Friend and Ivan Sutherland utilize toolmaking as part of their practice: some as open-source tools, some as participatory practice, some as tools for the individual artists. In what ways does digital toolmaking in relation to interactive art democratize the creation and consumption of art? In what ways might it be limited?
4. How might these works and artists reflect the evolution or changes in technology and art of its time?
