Art is a powerful tool for building a stronger connection between a person and their relationship to their surroundings. School, work, and life in general can take up so much time and attention that people can lose themselves in their schedule. Making art often requires close observation of a subject or environment. Engaging in this kind of close observation can provide respite from a routine, and provide an opportunity for rediscovering familiar surroundings. 

In this topic, we engage with the practice of close observation to find moments of repetition in our surroundings and recreate them using iteration in P5JS.

## Objectives
- Rediscovering and gaining inspiration from familiar surroundings through close observation
- Creating a larger whole through repeated 'small' elemetns
- **Visual Arts Vocabulary**: repetition, pattern, decomposition, constructive drawing


## Technical Terms & P5JS Elements
- iteration & for loops
- [random()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/random/)
- nested for loops

## Timeline
This project will take approximately five 45minute sessions:
1. Viewfinder walk and sketching. Sharing and receiving feedback on patterns.
2. Introduction to loops, practicing creating loops.
3. Creating the pattern (starting with the single element).
4. Creating the pattern (incorporating the loop, adding pseudo-randomness.
5. Presentation and sharing.


### Warm-Up Exercises
Some options for unplugged exercises:
**Viewfinder Walk**
- Students create a viewfinder by cutting out a rectangle out of a piece of cardstock or cardboard. Students go for a walk in a familiar area with the viewfinder, observing their school, home, neighborhood seeking out patterns. Patterns can be drawn from nature, architecture, textiles, or details.  
- Either by sketching or snapping a photo, students collect the patterns to draw inspiration from. 
- Students can share the patterns they found with their classmates and peers by playing a guessing game where they try to identify the source of the patterns. If students have found multiple patterns, they can use feedback from their peers to decide on which pattern to use. 

**Sketching a Base**
- Keeping the final medium of code in mind, students sketch out one element to be repeated using physical drawing tools. 
- For instance, if the source of the pattern is an old stone wall, how can circles, triangles, and rectangles be used to create a digital version of an old stone brick?
