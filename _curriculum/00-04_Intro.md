## Photography
### [*Glance Back*](https://glanceback.info/) (2021)
Maya Man

This project asks: What do you look like when you’re focused on your computer? This artist made a program that randomly takes a photo of you while you’re browsing the internet. It also asks what you’re thinking about. Over time, you build a collection of these surprise photos and thoughts.

> With this Chrome extension, once a day at random, when you open a new tab, Glance Back will quickly snap a photo of you and inquire: “What are you thinking about?”. Once you type your answer and press enter, the photo and thought will be collectively saved to your history of glances, cumulatively creating an archive of moments you share with your screen.

> When using our devices, we’re pulled into and solely focused on the glowing world that exists on the screen. We lose both an awareness of self and of the real world context surrounding us.

#### Let's Discuss
- What does this project show about the way we use computers? 
- How does the computer act like a camera and a journal? 
- How does this use of code shape our understanding of who is in control in digital spaces? 

**Tip:** If you use the Chrome browser, you can try *Glance Back* by installing the [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/glance-back/hgickafobcmcfffbjiamhhejkockfccm?pli=1).
