## Printmaking
### [*Decode Kolams*](https://aarati.online/rituals-of-recursion) (2025)
Made in [p5.js](https://p5js.org) by Aarati Akkapeddi

![Aarati Akkapeddi, Decode Kolams]({{ "https://aarati.online/media/pages/rituals-of-recursion/cf3c70f922-1744573498/print_detail2.jpg" | relative_url }})  
Close-up view of *Decode Kolams*, screen-printed pattern generated in p5.js. 

Kolams are beautiful patterns that women in South India have drawn for hundreds of years. 

> Kolams are traditionally made by women and created before sunrise. They comprise mathematically complex patterns that feature continuous intertwined lines.

In this project, the artist used code to turn text into binary (1s and 0s), then turned that into a design on a grid. The result honors an old tradition using a new tool and helps us consider how cultural heritage can be preserved or extended by technology.

#### Let's Discuss
- How is text turned into a pattern? 
- How can code help keep traditions like Kolams alive?
- Can you think of other traditional patterns that could be represented by code?

**Tip:** You are invited to encode text into a kolam pattern using Akkapeddi's software, [kolam.codes](https://kolam.codes/).
