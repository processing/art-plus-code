# Unit 4: Data Art

## Introduction

*How can art transform our relationship to data and information? How can we leverage computation’s ability to cull, sort, and interact with data to produce meaningful or exciting artwork? How might data and its uses engage the audience more deeply?* 

A fundamental concept in code is the input and the output — taking data in, and creating, refining, remapping something from it. Data, in this sense, is broader than the simple spreadsheet of numbers; but rather, the concept of how information is circulated throughout a system for optimization or curation. Data has become ubiquitous and far-reaching; from the ways that bits and bytes are physically stored to its persistence in organizing information. However, we can use this concept of data structure to look at how modern and contemporary artists are using all kinds of data and information to create meaningful artwork to reflect, resist and understand the current condition.

In this topic, we’ll use p5.js to create a sound-reactive art project, using variables to understand the way data can feed into various inputs and output.

## Related Artists Discussion Questions

1. In what ways do these artists challenge traditional notions of computation and coding? Conversely, how might they challenge traditional notions of art?
2. Some of the artists are utilizing art as a visualization technique for the data they’re wishing to delve deeper in; whereas some artists are utilizing art as a means to disrupt or remix the data from its initial origins to reproduce new meaning. What are some ways you’ve seen artists or communities take information and data to help bridge various understandings, reconnect to histories that were suppressed, or highlight archives that might be lost to the sands of time? 
3. Romi Morrison’s work takes physical manifestations of data (archived prints, archival material, and primary sources) and revisits them in a curation that allows for deeper conversation. How does this change or illicit new understandings of data in art? 
4. Mimi Onuoha curates a series of datasets that are missing as a new form of a dataset. How can datasets offer narrative, shape representation, or reveal biases?
