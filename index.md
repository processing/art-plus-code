The Art + Code Teacher Camp is an immersive professional development program designed to empower US-based educators to integrate fundamental software concepts into their K-12 art classrooms. Over the course of the program, participants explore a diverse curriculum that bridges code and art, predominantly using p5.js.

###Goals:
- Train K-12 arts educators how to use and integrate creative coding into arts education practice and classrooms
- Train teachers to use free and open-source coding tools to make interactive work and build lesson plans with a special focus on the visual arts
- Prioritize participation of teachers working with underserved student populations 
- Share materials generated from the workshop, for free and accessible to the public

The first iteration of Art+Code took place in the fall of 2024. Art+Code educator participants:
- Taught in K12 classrooms
- Worked with underserved populations
- Did not have a lot of experience with p5.js
- Had interesting ideas for how they would integrate code into their classrooms
