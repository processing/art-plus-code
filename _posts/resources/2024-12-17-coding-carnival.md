## Unit Design Highlights:

- Differentiated options; everyone contributes something unique and personally meaningful
- Collaborative process encourages unknown possibilities and exponential growth
- Game design presents opportunities for problem solving and problem generating
- Culminating celebration shares projects with a broader audience, making meaning beyond the assignment
- Unit plan is adaptable to a range of coding abilities

> ***Play is powerful*** - it limits overthinking, builds connections, decreases risk and invites new outcomes.
Games are fun because they allow us to use our creativity to solve problems. Designing games adds a
new layer of complexity; now, the artist is a problem solver and problem generator. In this unit plan we
engage with games, interactivity and play to create an immersive experience and share it with others. We
use collaboration to build upon each other’s ideas and provide a balance to the competition of games.

## Beginner artists will...

- Customize the visual features of a premade carnival
game, using co de to modify:
  * Color
  * Shape
  * Font
  * Background
  * Images
  * Sound
- Create unique carnival “prizes” using coding drawing features
- Invent creative titles for their carnival game and code them using embedded fonts

## Advanced artists will...

- Design the functional and aesthetic features of their own carnival games (problem solving and problem generating)
- Create a unique array of prizes using coding drawing features; determine parameters for winning and agree upon assigned value to points/prizes
- Decide how the physical space will be set up; what kind of flow will the visitors have throughout the space and how will that impact their carnival experience?
- Design with the visitor experience in mind (Who are the visitors? Younger students from the district? Family and friends? Teachers and peers?)

## Differentiation

The Coding Carnival encourages a differentiated output for each student in order to:

- Increase student ownership and excitement
  * Students should be able to speak passionately about their project and in their own words
- Decrease teacher control and invite unknown possibilities (following the improv tenet of ‘yes and’)
- Promote challenge and complexity
- Encourage unique, meaningful and personally relevant work

## Differentiated Option #1: Interactive carnival game
### Maze

### Ring Toss

###  Snowflake Catch

### Ball Toss

### Ice Cream Catch

### Breakout Game


## Differentiated Option #2: Prize or gift for carnival visitors
*Plushie / Toy / Merch / Sticker / Tickets / Tokens / Memorabilia / Poster / Wearable*


## Differentiated Option #3: Another element of the carnival that enhances the visitor experience

## Timeline

Depending on the age group and class frequency, this unit plan could span weeks to months.

### 1. Research

+ What are the elements of an engaging game?
+ History of games in coding
+ What are our favorite carnival games?
+ Play sample p5.js games, reflecting on the design decisions and player experience

### 2. Planning

+ Students select the experience they want to create
+ Students decide if they want to collaborate or work alone
+ Who are the visitors and how do we design with them in mind?

### 3. Building

+ Students work independently and with others to create carnival experiences
+ Build off each others’ ideas (‘yes and’) so the carnival grows exponentially
+ Test games as they’re built; debug as issues arise
+ What is the agreed system for awarding points/prizes?

### 4. Testing

+ Rehearsal with class and/or smaller audience
+ Who can welcome visitors, introduce the event, explain the creative process and answer questions?

### 5. Celebration

+ Invite school/district community, family, friends, etc
+ Assign someone to document the experience

### 6. Reflection

+ What are the takeaways? Highlights? Challenges?
+ What would you do differently next time?
+ Option to create an archive/artifact with event documentation
