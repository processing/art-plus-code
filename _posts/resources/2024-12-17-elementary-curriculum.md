## Introduction

I teach at Amesti Elementary in Watsonville, California. Agricultural fields surround us. Watsonville is famous for having the perfect weather to grow various berries, apples, and vegetables. The majority of our parents work in those fields. Until now, my students have been creating paintings of their parents performing their jobs in the fields. However, we want to go a step further and learn how to animate their painting using P5.
Because I teach elementary in a bilingual setting, my students need step-by-step Spanish and English guidance in order to succeed.
